# viw = "Vim which"
# Finds a script file, shell alias, or shell function and edits it.
# If it's an alias or function, it opens Vim right to the line where it's
# defined.
#
# Usage:
#
#     $ viw myalias
#     $ viw git-merge-to

# I am intentionally not quoting the result of $() because it may return 2
# strings (path and line number) which I want to be treated as 2 arguments, not
# 1.
